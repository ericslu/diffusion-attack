# Diffusion Attack
## UCLA ECE M117, Fall 2024: Team A1 Final Project
### Video Deepfake Detection
This project encapsulates varies aspects of Deepfake research and model building which we conducted for this course. In this repo, we have a ResNet model, a demonstrative attack, and a CNN-LSTM model. The source code is primarily used for image and video sequence processing and utilizes various Python datasets, mostly TensorFlow.
